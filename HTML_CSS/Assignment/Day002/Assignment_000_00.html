                <h2 id="apply">Application Process</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited really very long, almost <strong>7 months</strong>, to apply for ZS.  I often visit the Page to apply for ZS, But end up with <em>disappointment.</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I got to see there is,

                    </center>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    All of a sudden, There was an application form in the page.  I hurried to fill out the form, but I hadn't properly uploaded my projects in the <strong>GitHub</strong>.  So, I started to prepare the projects, collected all of them and moving them to a same folder, then committing and pushing them to my github repositories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I filled the form again and this time I properly submitted it.

                <h2>Interview Process</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applied for the ZS through <strong><em>examless approach</em></strong>, but got no update about that.  <em>I am really frustated that my projects were not selected.</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on <b>26th March 2025</b>, I <strong>got an email from Zoho that my projects were selected</strong>.  I had an interview in ZS, Tenkasi, on <b>2nd April</b>.  I am very afraid that I may not get selected in the interview process.  Even a day before the interview, I burned my shirt while ironing it, and I felt that as a bad omen.  I confirmed and affirmed myself that I am not going to get selected because of that bad omen feeling.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, I entered the <ins>Zoho Campus</ins> with thousands of questions and fears clouded on my head.  With <strong>fear</strong>, I attended the interview.  Almost <strong>15 students were shortlisted</strong> for interview. Only <strong><em>11</em> attended the interview process.</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Fortunately, I got selected in the Interview.</em></strong></p>

                <h2>Point where my Career started.</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I revisited the <strong>Zoho Campus</strong> on <strong>28th May</strong> - <strong>The First Day of my learning journey</strong>. We had an Induction Program on that day.  From the Next day, Classes started.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really love programming, and Now I am happy that Programming is now my Career.  I started learning further more eagerly.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got really awesome friendly faculties to teach me and to clarify my doubts.  Also, I got 29 (30 if myself included) new <strike>friends</strike> gems.</p>
                <p>I will barely forget that day, 28th May, where it all started</p>

                        We learnt programming concepts through <strong><em><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.  </em></strong>
                        We all did a Project with the Scratch.  
                        Now we are learning <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>.
